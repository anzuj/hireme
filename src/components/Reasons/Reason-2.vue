    I'm a <span class="font-weight-bold">self-taught web developer</span>  who made a complete career switch at 28. I spent 2 subsequent years practicing with online courses and freelance projects. Why would that be important to <span class="font-weight-bold">you</span> as my future employer?
    <ul class="mt-1">
      <li>That career switch shows <span class="text-decoration-underline">courage and determination</span>. Would you rather hire someone who coasted through university and does the bare minimum to get their paycheck, or someone who's so passionate about web development they stay up until 3 AM to make pixel perfection? ðŸ¤š</li>
      <li>University curriculums are often out of date. Online studying allows choosing courses that cover latest best practices and technical solutions.</li>

      <li>Having someone in your team with experience from another industry brings a fresh mindset and a new angle. For example I come packed with 4 years of experience from fintech, customer support and assistance of product management. <a href="https://dev.to/ajsmithsw/the-advantages-of-being-self-taught-2lcj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's</a> a great article from dev.to laying out the advantages of being self-taught. </li>
