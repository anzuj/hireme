    This login screen I made. It wasn't even part of my project tasks, but I made this from my own time just because I felt it added a nice touch to the UX. It takes an extra step to create a relationship between a product and its user (also, when your servers are known to be a bit slower at peak times, staring at an animated coffee cup is a lot more bearable than a blank page!)
