        <b>Mobile responsiveness</b>.I've seen plenty of cringeworthy sites with no
        consideration to mobile browsers. 55% of the web is handled in the palm
        of the hand, therefore I make sure that whatever I produce looks good
        regardless of the screen size.

        <v-row justify="center" class="mt-3">
            <v-img
                src="../../assets/images/responsive.png"
                contain
                alt="responsive example"
                max-width="350"
            />
        </v-row>
    </v-card-text>
</template>
