I'm an opensource contributor. This shows I have interest in web development that reaches further than my workplace duties.  Lately I'm enjoying being more involved in Vuetify community and writing articles on dev.to.

 Publishing tutorials is a multi-step process, so there a few drafts waiting to be reviewed by Vuetify's core team, but you may find some published things on my <a href="https://dev.to/anzelika" target="_blank">profile</a> too.
