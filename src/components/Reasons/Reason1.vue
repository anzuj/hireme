    I draw comic-style doodles. For example I drew the rainbow cat at the top of this page and brought it to life with some CSS animation magic. Wouldn't it be great to have someone in the team who can not only write code, but whip out a drawing tablet whenever the project calls for some illustrations?

    Here's a commission I did for a local cafe to print on their coffee mugs:

<v-container>
<v-row justify="center">
 <v-img src="../../assets/images/coffeecats.jpg" contain alt="coffee cats" />
</v-row>
</v-container>
    
While cats are my favourite subject (duh!), I'll happily get my hands dirty with any subject matter.
